### Pre-Work:
------------

#### 1. Code 501
If you are completely new to coding, this course will be extremely challenging. Our instructors would like to recommend our students to consider [Code 301](https://www.codefellows.org/courses/code-301/intermediate-software-development) as a prerequisite for the 501 if you do not have existing industry experience as a Software Developer.

#### 2. Ensure your laptop is up to the task of coding

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

#### 3. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system

Following completion of these Pre-work assignments, you should:
 - Have a terminal with a Git compatible prompt
 - Be able to receive a valid response when typing "git --version"

#### 4. Download and Install Java locally
 - [Download Link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)  

#### 5. Download and Install Slack

We use Slack to distribute files and collaborate before, during, and after the course.

  - [Download Slack](https://slack.com/apps)

Look for an email from us prior to the course, in order to join our Slack team.

#### Reminder:
Have a Project(App) idea in mind that you would enjoy building. This will come into play when students are asked to pitch ideas for the Project portion of the course.
